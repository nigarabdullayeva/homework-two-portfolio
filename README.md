# homework-two-portfolio

I created website with my current portfolio and links inside. 

I created three seperate html files ( index, portfolio, contact)
I created assets file with images and css folder inside 
I put all images inside images folder 
I create style.css file inside css folder 
I linked css file in all the three html files 

In all my html files I used semantic html tags 
I used Bootstrap components in all my html file 
I used grid, responsive images, responsive layouts and navbars 

All links in the html files are working , include portfolio links to my current work 

All htmls files are working on the different size gadjets
